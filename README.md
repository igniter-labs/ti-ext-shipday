TastyIgniter integrates with Shipday, allowing you to manage local delivery orders with an all-in-one local dispatch and delivery tracking system. Delivery orders can be quickly imported into Shipday's dispatch system for simple delivery management. Using Google Maps, you can quickly define route clusters on the map to optimise delivery stops and follow delivery drivers in real time.

From a single platform, you can use your own in house drivers or make use of third party delivery services like **DoorDash**, **Postmates** and **Uber** (only accessible in the US).

Shipday has a direct integration with TastyIgniter. Any delivery order a customer places on your TastyIgniter website will instantly be forwarded to Shipday for dispatch and delivery tracking.

### Features
- Restaurant owners can manage their deliveries efficiently on Shipday. This includes assigning drivers to orders and tracking deliveries
- Customers can track their orders in real-time and receive notifications about the estimated delivery time and the status of their order.
- Restaurant owners can manage their drivers, assign them to orders, and track their performance
