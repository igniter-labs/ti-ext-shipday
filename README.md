TastyIgniter integrates with Shipday, allowing you to manage local delivery orders with an all-in-one local dispatch and delivery tracking system. Delivery orders can be quickly imported into Shipday's dispatch system for simple delivery management. Using Google Maps, you can quickly define route clusters on the map to optimise delivery stops and follow delivery drivers in real time.

From a single platform, you can use your own in house drivers or make use of third party delivery services like **DoorDash**, **Postmates** and **Uber** (only accessible in the US).

Shipday has a direct integration with TastyIgniter. Any delivery order a customer places on your TastyIgniter website will instantly be forwarded to Shipday for dispatch and delivery tracking.

### Configuration

- Signup for a Shipday account.
- Install and enable the extension in your TastyIgniter website.
- Login to your Shipday account to get the Shipday API key under integrations tab
- Go to **System > Settings > Shipday Delivery Settings** to enter your API Key (follow instructions on the page)
- Choose a status under **Delivery Completed and Delivery Failed** to automatically update the order status when the delivery is marked as completed or failed.
- Now if anyone places a delivery order on your TastyIgniter site it should also appear on your Shipday dispatch dashboard.
