## Introduction

The TastyIgniter Shipday extension provides a seamless integration with Shipday, a local delivery management system. This extension allows restaurant owners to efficiently manage their local delivery orders, track deliveries in real-time, and optimize delivery routes using Shipday's powerful dispatch and tracking features.

From a single platform, you can use your own in house drivers or make use of third party delivery services like **DoorDash**, **Postmates** and **Uber** (only accessible in the US).

Shipday has a direct integration with TastyIgniter. Any delivery order a customer places on your TastyIgniter website will instantly be forwarded to Shipday for dispatch and delivery tracking.

## Features

- Delivery orders can instantly sent to Shipday's dispatch system for simple delivery management
- Using Google Maps, you can quickly define route clusters on the map to optimize delivery stops and follow delivery drivers in real time
- Restaurant owners can manage their deliveries efficiently from Shipday Dashboard. This includes assigning drivers to orders and tracking deliveries
- Customers can track their orders in real-time and receive notifications about the estimated delivery time and the status of their order
- Restaurant owners can manage their drivers, assign them to orders, and track their performance
- Integrates well with TastyIgniter's checkout process, allowing customers to see their delivery costs
